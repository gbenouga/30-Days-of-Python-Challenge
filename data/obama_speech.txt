My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak to you about what the United States will do with our friends and allies to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.

As Commander-in-Chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people.

Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the fight to terrorists who threaten our country.

We took out Osama bin Laden and much of al Qaeda's leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

We've targeted al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in Somalia.
