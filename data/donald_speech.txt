My fellow Americans: Today, I want to tell the world that America First does not mean America alone.

When the United States grows, so does the world.

American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe.

And the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives.
