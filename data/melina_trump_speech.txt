Thank you very much. One year ago, I introduced my husband when he declared his candidacy.

Here we are again. This time as the Republican nominee for President of the United States of America.

From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for your support.

It is an honor to be here tonight and to share the stage with my husband who I love very much.
