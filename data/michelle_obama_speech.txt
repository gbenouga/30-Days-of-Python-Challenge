Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you for that very kind introduction.

When I first met Barack, he took me on a date to a community meeting.

I know, how romantic, right?

But when we walked in, Barack immediately went up to this group of older women who were sitting in the front row.

And he sat down and he started talking and listening to what they had to say.
